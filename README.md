# Steam Deck controller layouts

My [controller layouts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804823261) for games/applications running on [Steam Deck](https://steamdeck.com/) in Gaming mode.

The numbers in the beginning of folders names are Steam App IDs. If there is no number, then this is a non-Steam game/application.

## How to use it

Download layout file and put it to where the game expects it to be:

```
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Steam Controller Configs/YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID/config/GAME-NAME/controller_neptune.vdf
```

Also replace `25344765` in file with your `AccountID`.
